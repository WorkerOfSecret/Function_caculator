This is a simple caculator that can do simple caculate with +, -, /, *, sin, cos, tan and log created in Ubuntu

I have to say it is a little bit different from normal caculator in the way you input the number and others things

First:
    To compile the file use the command: gcc -o caculator_ver1.0 caculator_ver1.0 -lm

Second:
    Well you know how to use the file so I will move to Third

Third:
    You can only input 
=======
 Caculator_ver1.0 is a simple program for caculator with +, -, *, /, sin, cos, tan and log function. 
 It is a little bit different from normal caculator because of its input and few functions.
 
 At the first time you input the caculation:
   You can only input two numbers and one operator ( '+', '-', '*', '/') at the first time you ativate it
   For example: 
    "6+10", "10/s45" (put a word 's', 'c', 't', 'l' in front of the number to activate the sin, cos, tan, log function)
 
 Second:
   After the first time you can only input an operator and a number to keep caculating your caculation
   For example: 
     "-c60" ( - cos(60) ), "*l10" ( * log(10) )
   If you want to do a new caculation please input : "*0" to make a new one
 
 Third:
   I putted two debugs inside of the program so if you don't follow the first two things it will out put the ERRORS
   For example:
     If you input something that isn't an operator between two numbers or in front of the number after first input it will give back
     a message like this "ERROR: THERE IS NO SUCH OPERATOR PLEASE INPUT ONE MORE TIME" and a anothere message if you try messing with the 
     number (For ex: "-adskda121") it will give back another message like this "ERRORS: THERE IS NO SUCH FUNCTION PLEASE INPUT ONE MORE 
     TIME"
 Final:
   I am making a normal caculator like those apps in smart phone or computer so there will be more update
