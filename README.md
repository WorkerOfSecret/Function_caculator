This is a simple caculator that can do simple caculate with +, -, /, *, sin, cos, tan and log created in Ubuntu

I have to say it is a little bit different from normal caculator in the way you input the number and others things

First:
    To compile the file use the command: gcc -o caculator_ver1.0 caculator_ver1.0 -lm

Second:
    Well you know how to use the file so I will move to Third

Third:
    You can only input
