                                        FUNCTION CACULATOR REPORT



  This is a simple caculator that can do simple caculate with +, -, /, *, answer, sin, cos, tan, 
factorial and log created in Ubuntu

It has three modes: caculation mode, lazy mode, exit mode

  To choose the mode you input 'y', 'n', 'b' into the terminal when asked "DO YOU WANT TO CACULATE"
press 'y' to enter the caculation mode
press 'n' to enter the lazy mode
press 'b' to enter the exit mode


1__Caculation mode:

First:
  You can only input :
    Caculator_ver1.0 is a simple program for caculator with +, -, *, /, sin, cos, tan, 
    factorial, log function and caculate with the answer. 
  

  At the first time you input the caculation:
    You can only input two numbers and one operator ( '+', '-', '*', '/') at the first time you 
    ativate it
   
    For example: 
      "6+10", "10/s45" (put a word 's', 'c', 't', 'a', '!', 'l' in front of the number to 
      activate the sin, cos, tan, answer, factorial, log function)
 

Second:
   After the first time you can only input an operator and a number to keep caculating your 
   caculation
   
   For example: 
      "-c60" ( - cos(60) ), "*l10" ( * log(10) ), "-a ( - the last answer)"
   
   If you want to do a new caculation please input : "*0" or '-a' to make a new one
 

Third:
   I putted two debugs inside of the program so if you don't follow the first two things it 
   will output the ERRORS
   
   For example:
     If you input something that isn't an operator between two numbers or in front of the number
      after first input it will give back a message like this: 
        "ERROR: THERE IS NO SUCH OPERATOR PLEASE INPUT ONE MORE TIME" 
      
      and a anothere message if you try messing with the number (For ex: "-adskda121") 
      it will give back another message like this: 
        "ERRORS: THERE IS NO SUCH FUNCTION PLEASE INPUT ONE MORE TIME"

Final:
   To quit the caculation use "qq" and you will go back to the mode's selection


2__Lazy mode:
   You will receive a same weird string 10 times

3__Exit mode:
   Exit the program
